# CC-PROJET-1
In this project we  created an  application image for a static website  that uses the Express Node.js  framework and Bootstrap front-end  library. 
then we pushed the image  to Docker Hub for future use and then ran our container using that image. Finally, we pulled  the stored image from my Docker Hub
repository and ran another container.
